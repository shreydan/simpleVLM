# Vision Language Model

- Built by implementing LLaMA from scratch with sft-weights from SmolLM2, and siglip2 as vision encoder.
- Vision projector is a LlaMA MLP style projection block (~3M params)
- Total model size: 230M

> See `eval.ipynb` for inference

stage2: openbmb/RLAIF-V-Dataset
```

- super basic training in bf16
- the results are decent
